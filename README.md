## ClassicalML

#### Experiment with feature extraction methods to process image data and use classic data analysis and machine learning algorithms with Fashion MNIST dataset

Explore Training Data set: checking class distribution.
Explore Test Data set.
Feature Engineering: Checking missing dataset.
Splitting train and test data: We will do it on the Training dataset and rename our split test dataset as
Validation dataset.
Explore if the classes can be made categorical seeing the image pattern.
Feature Scaling.

Feature Extraction and visualization: Capturing maximum variance or representation of the features.
  - PCA: Find out the best components range that captures most of the variance
  - Kernel PCA: For visualization
  - Locally-Linear Embedding (LLE): For visualization
  - t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE): For visualization
  - LDA: For visualization

Algorithms:
  • KNN.
  • SVM.
  • Decision Tree Classifier.
  • Random Forest Classifier.
  • Adaboost for DTC and RFC.
  • Gradient Boosting Classifier: Use scikit-learn and XGBoost Library.
