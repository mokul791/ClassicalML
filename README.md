## ClassicalML

#### Experiment with feature extraction methods to process image data and use classic data analysis and machine learning algorithms with Fashion MNIST dataset

Dataset: Fashion MNIST from https://www.kaggle.com/

Feature Extraction and visualization: Capturing maximum variance or representation of the features.
  - PCA: Find out the best components range that captures most of the variance
  - Kernel PCA: For visualization
  - Locally-Linear Embedding (LLE): For visualization
  - t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE): For visualization
  - LDA: For visualization

Algorithms:
  - KNN
  - SVM
  - Decision Tree Classifier
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Adaboost for DTC and RFC
  - Gradient Boosting Classifier: Use scikit-learn and XGBoost Library
